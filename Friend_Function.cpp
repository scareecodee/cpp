Friend Function in C++
A friend function in C++ is a special function that is not a member of a class but is granted access to the class's private and protected members.

| Feature                               | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a member**                      | Defined outside the class.                      |
| **Access**                            | Has access to private and protected members.    |
| **Declaration**                       | Declared inside class with `friend` keyword.    |
| **Definition**                        | Defined outside using normal function syntax.   |
| **No `this` pointer**                 | Since itâ€™s not a member.                        |
| **Can be global or in another class** | Can be standalone or a member of another class. |


5. Can Be a Friend of Multiple Classes
You can declare the same function as a friend in multiple classes.
